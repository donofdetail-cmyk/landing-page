For a full interior & exterior detail, the average client should expect to spend between $250 and $400. Because every vehicle is different, we require you to submit a form to get a custom quote."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A full interior & exterior detail typically takes 3–5 hours depending on the vehicle's size and condition. Ceramic coating installs take 1–2 days. We work efficiently without cutting corners — you can go about your day while we handle everything on-site."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Absolutely. Reno's 300+ days of intense UV, high-elevation sun, road salt from Tahoe trips, and desert dust make ceramic coating one of the best investments you can make for your vehicle. A professionally applied ceramic coating provides years of hydrophobic protection, UV resistance, and keeps your paint looking factory-fresh."

            "@type": "Answer",

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A car wash removes surface dirt; a professional detail restores and protects. We use pH-balanced soaps, clay bar decontamination, machine polishing, and premium protectants to eliminate swirl marks, oxidation, and embedded grime that automated washes simply cannot address. The result is a finish that lasts months, not days."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "For most drivers in Reno, we recommend a full detail every 3–4 months due to the harsh desert environment. Vehicles with ceramic coatings need less frequent deep cleans — a maintenance wash every 6–8 weeks keeps the coating performing at its best. Daily drivers and vehicles parked outside benefit most from regular protection."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Reno has notoriously hard water — tap water leaves mineral deposits that etch into clear coat over time. Our deionized water is purified to 0 PPM, delivering a completely spot-free rinse that protects your paint and leaves zero residue. It's one of the details that separates a professional detail from a DIY wash."
